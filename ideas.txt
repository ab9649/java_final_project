##King move with check functionality
King possible moves function: retList.removeAll(checkSet) - remove all checks positions
add check boolean to king
if retList = {} and king check == true END GAME

##check functionality
have white and black checkSets which store all checked locations on board
caluclate possible locations before clicking on piece? add possible locations set to checkset (issue when changing set after moving (what if another piece also checks same spot)

-possibility?: after move, run is_king_checked() ON BOTH KINGS to check each square around each king for possible check piece and if exists king.setchecked(true)
        -if your piece becomes checked, reset move
  -benefit: more efficient
   -cons:calculating checkmate harder
      -could be accomplished by running second function if is_checked returns true to check if each possible move square for king return is_checked(true)
          -messy
         
         
-brute Force: after calling move in mouse release, run possible locations on every remaining piece of that color and store in set
            - have to also call possible locations on every opposite color piece to see if moving would expose a check (if it does reset to previous square)
  -benefit: will make caluclate check mate work as above
  -will work
  -might not slow down game since at end of turn, (player needs to think might not notice)
  cons: feels disgusting

  issues:
  king cannot take pieces that are checking him ##solved
  cannot use other pieces to take checking pieces ##solves


  need to find way to calculate checkmate when using other pieces could solve check - think i have to check every move of every piece of that color.
