##King move with check functionality
King possible moves function: retList.removeAll(checkSet) - remove all checks positions
add check boolean to king
if retList = {} and king check == true END GAME

##check functionality
have white and black checkSets which store all checked locations on board
caluclate possible locations before clicking on piece? add possible locations set to checkset (issue when changing set after moving (what if another piece also checks same spot)

-possibility?: after move, run is_king_checked() to check each square around king for possible check piece and if exists king.setchecked(true)
  -benefit: more efficient
   -cons:calculating checkmate harder
         !!!!!!!!!!!!!if moving a piece exposes check it will not register !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-brute Force: after calling move in mouse release, run possible locations on every remaining piece of that color and store in set
  -benefit: will make caluclate check mate work as above
  -might not slow down game since at end of turn, (player needs to think might not notice)
  cons: feels disgusting
